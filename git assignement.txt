Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps to complete the tasks in your Git assignment:

**Task 1: Initialize a repository on git.**
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your repository.
- Type `git init` to initialize a new repository.

**Task 2: Add members to the git repo with different access (collab with other members).**
- Go to your repository on the Git hosting service (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab and then to the "Collaborators" or "Members" section.
- Add members by entering their username or email address and selecting the appropriate access level.

**Task 3: Create a new branch from the repository. (D-<yourname>)**
- In your terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the root directory of your repository.
- Type `git checkout -b D-<yourname>` to create a new branch and switch to it.

**Task 4: Make changes and commit and push to your repository.**
- Make changes to your files as needed.
- Type `git add <file>` to stage the changes for commit.
- Type `git commit -m "<commit message>"` to commit the changes.
- Type `git push origin D-<yourname>` to push the changes to your remote repository.

**Task 5: Raise a merge request to the main repository.**
- Go to your repository on the Git hosting service.
- Navigate to the "Pull Requests" or "Merge Requests" section and click on "New Pull Request" or "New Merge Request".
- Select the base branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the compare branch (`D-<yourname>`).
- Fill in the necessary information and submit the pull request.

**Task 6: If there are conflicts, resolve them and merge them.**
- If there are conflicts, you will be notified in the pull request.
- Follow the instructions provided by the Git hosting service to resolve the conflicts.
- Once resolved, commit and push the changes.
- Merge the pull request.

**Task 7: Make changes to a file and rollback.**
- Make changes to a file as needed.
- Type `git add <file>` to stage the changes for commit.
- Type `git commit -m "<commit message>"` to commit the changes.
- To rollback, type `git revert <commit hash>` where `<commit hash>` is the hash of the commit you want to revert.

**Task 8: Make changes and stash them, checkout a new branch.**
- Make changes to your files as needed.
- Type `git stash` to stash the changes.
- Type `git checkout -b <new branch>` to create and switch to a new branch.
- To apply the stashed changes, type `git stash apply`.
